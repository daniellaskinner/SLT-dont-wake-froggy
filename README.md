- SASS
- TYPESCRIPT
- NODE.JS
- PHASER NPM PACKAGE
- WEBPACK MODULE BUNDLER
- YARN PACKAGE MANAGER

## How to play the game:
### Move froggy to the lilypad to reveal a word to practise, once you have said the word move to find the next lilypad.

##notes for nelly:
- ribbet noise when land on lilypad
- when land on lilypad word pops up on screen- modal or something, the game freezes for 30 seconds
- later on could add a timer option for the therapist/adult to select how long (s) they want the word to remain on the screen
- word/modal dissapears and another lilypad pops up somewhere else
- in future to add record the child's iteration of the word and compare to mark it
